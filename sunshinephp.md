# SunshinePHP 

Website: http://sunshinephp.com

- It's Miami in winter (early February). Don't bring your coat. Outside it's hot! Inside it's chilly (air conditioned).
- This conference is not that crowded. So you can basically step into a room 30 seconds before a talk starts.
- It takes place in an airport hotel called Embassy Suites by Hilton.
- There is a hotel shuttle from the airport. It runs on the half hour and very easy to miss. You can call the hotel and have them send it back, or if you prefer, Lyft/Uber generally has ten plus cars driving around so you wont be at the airport for long.
- If you stay in the hotel you'll be able to hang around the speakers for 48+ hours, so a lot of networking opportunities.
- Also if you stay in the hotel you'll be able to enjoy the happy hour after conference hours. If not: bad luck.
- There is breakfast with string coffee and lunch provided by the conference. Vegetarian options available.
- Soda drinks at all times (USA)
- There's chilled water in every room.

- Miami things to see:
    - Miami Beach (South Beach)
    - Downtonw Miami
    - Design District
    - Wynwood: VERY lively neighbourhood
    - Sugar: an expensive rooftop bar with a view over the downtown skyline
    - Dogma: a Hot Dog place far away from the conference, but gotta get the original thing, right?
