### About The Conference

SunshinePHP is a local run user group conference. Ran by [SoFloPHP](https://www.meetup.com/South-Florida-PHP-Users-Group/), [Adam Culp](https://twitter.com/adamculp) has been organizing this conference for over 4 years. He brings together a large skillset in speakers ranging from Laravel Experts, Zend Framework Experts, DevOps magicians, and so many more. You are bound to leave this conference ready to implement new tools and ideas into your existing workflow. 

### Tips

- It's Miami in winter (early February). Don't bring your coat. Outside it's hot! Inside it's chilly (air conditioned).
- This conference is not that crowded. So you can basically step into a room 30 seconds before a talk starts.
- It takes place in an airport hotel called Embassy Suites by Hilton.
- There is a hotel shuttle from the airport. It runs on the half hour and very easy to miss. You can call the hotel and have them send it back, or if you prefer, Lyft/Uber generally has ten plus cars driving around so you wont be at the airport for long.
- If you stay in the hotel you'll be able to hang around the speakers for 48+ hours, so a lot of networking opportunities.
- Also if you stay in the hotel you'll be able to enjoy the happy hour after conference hours. If not: bad luck (there are ways around this).
- There is breakfast with strong coffee and lunch provided by the conference. Vegetarian options available.
- Soda drinks at all times (USA)
- There's chilled water in every room.
- Provides an uncon space as well, so if you are attending and get the urge to speak there is a possibility for you to do that. 
- Hotel has a bar and restaurant on site, a good way to socialize and meet other developers. Can be pricey though!

### Speakers

- The conference will get you three nights in the hotel, four if you are doing a tutorial as well. 
- There is a speaker dinner the Thursday night before the conference. 
- Flights in and out of Miami are always at odd times, so be ready for that. 
- Your room key is how you take advantage of the free happy hour the hotel offers. 
- There is a business center, gym and pool. Its warm in Miami during February, so swimming is an option. 
- The rooms ar generally kept cooler then average, so if you are the first talk in the morning, prepare for being a little chilly. 
- Bring all the adapters you can think of for your computer. Some of the more seasoned speakers will be able to cover you if you forget a dongle. 
- As always, the conference wifi isnt great. They put access points in every room, but do your best to not rely on the internet. 
- If you forgot something at home, there is a small shop that can get you most personal care things. 

### Things To See

- Miami Beach (South Beach)
- Downtown Miami
- Design District
- Wynwood: VERY lively neighbourhood
- Sugar: an expensive rooftop bar with a view over the downtown skyline
- Dogma: a Hot Dog place far away from the conference, but gotta get the original thing, right?
