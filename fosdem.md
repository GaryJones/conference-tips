### Tips

- Rooms are usually packed pretty soon. Come early to get a seat.
- Since you might spend a long time in a single room it's best to bring a bottle of water.
- Don't need to bring food. Plenty of food options from the food trucks and much dinner options around the venue.
- [FOSDEM Companion](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=fosdem&fdid=be.digitalia.fosdem) is an invaluable Android app to, among other things, help you plan your schedule before the conference and get maps and reminders at the conference.
