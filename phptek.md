Location: Atlanta, GA

PHP[TEK}, brought to you by the people who run PHPArch, returns for the 12th year, this time taking place in Atlanta, GA. They bring
some of the best speakers, both local and international to speak about topics varying from framework specific to soft skills. They offer
both technical talks and tutorial days. A conference that every developer should go to at least once, you will leave energized and ready
to tackle some big problems you have in your codebase!

- Being in Atlanta, GA this year opens up the possibility for some reasonable flights. Since Hartsfield Jackson International Airport 
handles an insane amount of traffic, you should not have a hard time finding a flight at a cost your employer wont balk at. 
- The hotel is right at the airport, so you do not have to worry about transportation or being far from the airport. 
- Atlanta does have a transit system, albeit not amazing (former Atlanta resident writing this). You can get to a few nightspot hubs 
but you may also have to use Lyft/Walk a few minutes from the train station.
- The organizers always put on a great after conference day social events. They are a great opportunity to relax and socialize a bit 
with attendees and speakers alike. 
- As of last year, PHP[TEK] did livestream their keynotes.
