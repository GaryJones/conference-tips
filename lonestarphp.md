- The main airport in Dallas is 45 minutes away. You should try to plan accordingly to ride along with another conference goer. Alternatively there is a smaller airport right by the conference, but the ticket prices are exponetially higher due to the smaller airport.
- There is no "conference" hotel, but the Hyatt House Hotel is the closest and one most conference goes prefer.
